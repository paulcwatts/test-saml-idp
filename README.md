# Test SAML IdP

This is a very simple SAML Identity Provider (IdP) you can use to test your SAML
Service Provider (SP) implementation with. It's very basic right now, it allows
you to login and response with a signed SAML response. It also supports SAML Logout.

# TODO: Configuration

There are two things you need to configure:

1. The SAML key and certificate used to sign the response;
2. The list of username/passwords that are considered valid.
